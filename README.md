## Introduction

In this section, the video introduces the two main integration techniques: using the same infrastructure and passing data through JSON or having separate infrastructures for independent deployments and enhanced productivity.

## Same Infrastructure Integration

This section covers the details of integrating React with Django in the same infrastructure, discussing the challenges and benefits of this approach.

## Separate Infrastructures Integration

Explore the advantages of having separate infrastructures for React and Django, including independent deployments and automatic failover.

## Setting up React with Vite in Django

Learn how to set up a front-end React application within a Django back-end project using Vite. The process includes creating a front-end folder, setting up a new React project, and integrating it into the Django project.

## Connecting Static Files

Understand how to connect static files from the front-end React application to the back-end Django server. The section covers importing the OS module, connecting static files directories, and writing code under roll-up options.

## Production-Level Integration

This section explains the steps to integrate React-Vite and Django for a production-level application. Topics include adding static files to Django settings, disabling debug mode, and configuring the HTML for production.

## Building and Debugging

Explore the process of building and debugging a React application using Vite and Django. Understand the importance of debugging, controlling debug mode, and resolving common issues.

## Hot Module Replacement and Django Integration

Learn how to use Vite's hot module replacement feature to manage new static files created by Django. The section emphasizes the importance of handling small errors and ensuring correct file names.

## Alternative Method: Separate Codebases

Discover an alternative method of having two separate codebases for React and Django. This includes using Create React App with Websockets for real-time data communication and setting up the environment for successful deployment.

## Enabling CORS for Secure Asset Fetching

Understand the importance of CORS setup for secure asset fetching. The section covers the installation of plugins, enabling CORS headers, and adding CORS allowed origins in the middleware.

## Linking Django REST Framework with React-Vite

Explore the integration of Django REST Framework with React-Vite, including setting up session authentication and adding CORS middleware and headers.

## Conclusion

The speaker concludes the video by summarizing the integration techniques and addressing the complexities of integrating a React front-end with a Django back-end.
